This is a repository for sample Eucalyptus IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy files.  

To generate eIAM policy files you can also use the AWS policy generator to build templates: http://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html.  Alternatively you can build them by hand and memory like real men do ;)
